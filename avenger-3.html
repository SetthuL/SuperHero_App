      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Dr. Bruce Banner is a brilliant scientist who was exposed to high levels of gamma radiation during an experiment gone wrong. This transformed him into the Hulk—a powerful green-skinned giant with immense strength and durability, triggered by emotional stress and anger. Despite his struggle to control the Hulk persona, Bruce has become a key member of the Avengers and continues to fight for good while seeking balance between his two identities. In later years, he merges his intelligence with the Hulk’s strength to become Professor Hulk.</p>
